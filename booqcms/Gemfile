gemspec
# Declare your gem's dependencies in booqcms.gemspec.
# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and
# development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.


# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use a debugger
# gem 'byebug', group: [:development, :test]

gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'bourbon'
gem 'neat'
