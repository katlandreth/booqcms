  <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>

  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally
  Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not
  include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website,
  conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep
  this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is
  appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or
  others' rights, property or safety.</p>

  <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to
    other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

  <h3>Third-party links</h3>

  <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products
    or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent
    privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content
    and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity
    of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

  <h3>Google</h3>

  <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising
    Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.
    You can find them here: <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</a></p>

  <h4>We may use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</h4>

  <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's
    use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous
    visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the
    use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.</p>

  <p>We may have implemented the following Google services in addition to others not named here:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
        <li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li>
      </ul>

  <p>We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as
    the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie)
    or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions
    with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</p>

    Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising
    Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p>

  <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

  <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States to require commercial websites
    and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well
    beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
    (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally
    Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
    policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those
    individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. </p>

  <h4>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
    <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or at a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
    <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li>

  You can change your personal information by emailing us.</p>

  <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>

  <p>We cannot guarantee that third party services such as Google Analytics will honor
  Do Not Track (DNT) signals. The DNT standard is currently under development,
  and we don't specifically monitor or honor all DNT requests. However, some features may honor DNT signals.</p>

  <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
  <p>Yes. We may use third party systems to track user behaviors across our site.
    This information may be used to provide you with a better experience while visiting the site.</p>

  <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

  <p>The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
  which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services
    directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites
    or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal
    information online from a child under 13 years of age."
    - <i>via</i> <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">FTC.gov</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We do not collect age information about visitors of the site, and we do not specifically
    market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

  <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
  responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

  <p>We will notify you via email or other appropriate means of contact as soon
    as possible after the breach has been recognized.</p>

  <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

  <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
  requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
  stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

  <p>It is never our intention to 'spam' you. We may collect your email address in order to:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
        <li>Process orders and send information and updates pertaining to orders</li>
        <li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
        <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</li>
      </ul>

  <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
  <ul>
        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
        <li>If the message is an advertisement, we will identify it as such in some reasonable way</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used</li>
